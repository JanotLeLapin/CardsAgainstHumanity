# Cards against humanity

Arguably the funniest game in the world. Requires friends.

## Config file

This implementation doesn't come with cards out of the box (for legal reasons), so you'll need to come up with your own. Take a look at the [example config file](./config.example.toml) if you need inspiration, and store your actual config at the root in a `config.toml` file.
